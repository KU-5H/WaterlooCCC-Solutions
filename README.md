# WaterlooCCCSolutions
A list of solutions for the Waterloo CCC (Canadian Computing Competition) that I've completed so far

**Some things to note about the solutions:**
  - They are all coded in java since that's the language I best know 
  - There's not too many comments in the code (So it'll be hard to understand)
  - There's only a handful of years and solutions currently (I'm not the best at coding LOL) 
  - All solutions are currently junior level (senior will be added once I learn it)
  - If the name of the file has a T then it means its not completed yet (or at least the code dosen't get full marks in the submission)
  - You may notice that there are packages for each of the files. Simply ignore those as they only exist since I'm writing the solution in folders.
  - If you see a j and s in the file name know that it is both a junior and senior level problem (Ex. 2013 j3 is also the 2013 s1 question)
