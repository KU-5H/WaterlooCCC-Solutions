# WaterlooCCCSolutions
A list of solutions for the Waterloo CCC (Canadian Computing Competition) that I've completed so far

Some things to note about the solutions:

-They are all coded in java since that's the language I best know

-There's not too many comments in the code (So it'll be hard to understand)

-There's only a handful of years and solutions currently (I'm not the best at coding LOL) 

-All solutions are currently junior level (senior will be added once I learn it)

<small>Also pls don't jusge my code I'm not that good at it ðŸ˜ž</small>
